# Scoreboard-Expansion
 
This Minecraft Bedrock addon aims to add more capabilities to the scoreboard system while still maintaining compatibility with other addons. It adds some of the java edition scoreboard criteria as well as new ones that may help in some situations.
This addon does require the GameTest Framework experiment to work.

The documentation for criteria can be found [Here](packs/BP/docs/criteria.md)

Please report bugs or suggest new criteria [Here](https://github.com/MajestikButter/Scoreboard-Expansion/issues)
